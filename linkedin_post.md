Hook: Violence, Violence, Violence... I don't like it. I avoid it. But high-performance UI? I like it. 🔨💰

Body: I just deployed my latest project: a premium, cinematic tribute to K.G.F Chapter 2.
This isn't just a static landing page. It's an immersive experience built to push the limits of **React 19** & **Framer Motion**.

I focused heavily on "Micro-interactions" and "Perceived Performance"—ensuring every hover, scroll, and click feels heavy and expensive, just like gold.

Key Features:
✅ **"Flashlight Reveal" Hero Section** (Mouse-tracked lighting effects) 🔦
✅ **Magnetic Buttons** & **3D Tilt Character Cards** (Physics-based interactions) 🧲
✅ **Cinematic "Empire Disrupted" Error Boundary** (No more white screens) 🛡️
✅ **100/100 Lighthouse Score** (Smart Lazy Loading + Asset Optimization) ⚡
